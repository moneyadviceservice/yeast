Yeast
=====

Shared SASS mixins, variables and functions for MAS apps and engines.

The reason this exists is because Dough was originally supplying these mixins to the engines. We have since removed these are as they are specific to MAS rather than the generic component library that is Dough.

We now need a way to provide a consistent way of dealing with media queries, colour variables etc etc across all the projects.

Enter Yeast.
